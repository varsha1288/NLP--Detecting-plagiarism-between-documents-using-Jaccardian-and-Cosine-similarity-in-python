      "2 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did three Metro cars derail during rush hour on Friday? Excessive heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, the tenth day in a row with temperatures over 95 degrees in the D.C. area, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority released a statement saying that investigators think this summer’s heatwave likely caused a “heat kink” in the tracks, which in turn caused the derailment:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Investigators have determined that a misalignment of the rails, known as a “heat kink,” was a probable cause of yesterday’s derailment near West Hyattsville Station. Three cars of an inbound Green Line train derailed at approximately 4:45 p.m. as the train entered a tunnel from an outdoor section of track. There were no injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Heat kinks are short sections of misaligned track caused by the expansion of metal rails in extremely high temperatures and prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. When the expanding rail cannot be constrained by cross-ties and ballast, the rail may expand outward from the normal track alignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "WMATA spokesperson Caroline Lukas told The Huffington Post that there is a speed restriction of 35 miles per hour in place for trains using tracks that are exposed to the sun, and that this restriction will last “at least for the duration of the weekend.” Lukas also said WMATA has “increased track inspections” to look for any other heat kinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also being affected by the heat: roads. WTOP reports that, according to officials, “buckled pavement” is “prevalent” in both Virginia and Maryland.\n",

      "No injuries were reported as a result of the derailment, but 55 passengers were evacuated and a pregnant woman was taken to the hospital for observation.\n",

      "Tokyo (CNN) -- Japan began dumping thousands of tons of radioactive water into the Pacific Ocean on Monday, an emergency move officials said was needed to curtail a worse leak from the crippled Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "In all, about 11,500 tons of radioactive water that has collected at the nuclear facility will be dumped into the sea, officials said Monday, as workers also try to deal with a crack that has been a conduit for contamination.\n",
      "\n",
      "The radiation levels were highest in the water that was being drained from reactor No. 6, the officials said.\n",
      "\n",
      "These are the latest but hardly the only challenges facing workers at the embattled power plant and its six reactors, which have been in constant crisis since last month's ruinous earthquake and tsunami.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials with Tokyo Electric Power Company, which runs the plant, proposed the release of excess water that has pooled in and around the Nos. 5 and 6 reactors into the sea. But most of the dumped water -- 10,000 tons -- will come from the plant's central waste treatment facility, which will then be used to store highly radioactive water from the No. 2 unit, an official with the power company said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The water in reactors Nos. 5 and 6 is coming from a subdrain and wasn't inside the building itself, officials said. Tests suggest that groundwater is the source of the contamination in these two units, but they are not certain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano called the dumping \"unavoidable.\" The liquid was most likely contaminated in the process of trying to cool nuclear fuel rods.\n",
      "Japanese farmers lament\n",
      "U.S. city helps sister city in Japan\n",
      "We need to stop the release into the seawater as soon as possible\n",
      "--Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano\n",
      "RELATED TOPICS\n",
      "\n",
      "    Japan\n",
      "\n",
      "The scope of the dump was staggering.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For an idea about how much is 11,500 tons, one metric ton is 1,000 kilograms or about 2,200 pounds, which is close to an English ton. Water is about 8.5 pounds per gallon, so one ton is about 260 gallons,\" said Gary Was, a professor of nuclear engineering at the University of Michigan. \"So 11,500 tons is about 3 million gallons. A spent fuel pool holds around 300,000 gallons. So this amount of water is equivalent to the volume of roughly 10 (spent fuel pools).\"\n",
      "\n",
      "It could take 50 hours to dump all the water, Tokyo Electric said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The dumping of so much radioactive water into the ocean conjures up fears of mutated sea life and contamination of the human food chain, but experts said the radiation will be quickly diluted, minimizing risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"To put this in perspective, the Pacific Ocean holds about 300 trillion swimming pools full of water and they're going to release about five swimming pools full of water. So hopefully the churning of the ocean and the currents will quickly disperse this so that it gets to very dilute concentrations relatively quickly,\" said Timothy Jorgensen, chair of the radiation safety committee at Georgetown University Medical Center.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"It's a considerable amount of water, but the immensity of the Pacific Ocean will quickly dilute this amount of water to harmless levels,\" he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "John Till, president of Risk Assessment Corp., similarly cited the vastness of the ocean in helping to minimize harm, and said he does not expect to see any permanent effects on marine life, even close in to the plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, he said officials should continue to monitor the radiation levels closely.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What we have to watch is how these materials accumulate in food products and then could be consumed by people,\" Till said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The build-up of water could cause problems around the nuclear facility, which is 240 kilometers (150 miles) north of Tokyo, Edano said Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities have made a priority of dealing with water from the No. 2 unit, some of which has been gushing into the sea through a crack in a concrete shaft.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The radioactivity level is very high near the No. 2 reactor, and we know this. We have to stop the leak as early as possible to prevent this from going into the sea,\" Edano said. \"The radioactivity level is much less in the water from the Nos. 3 and 4 units.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency officials said Monday night that the hope is that pumping out the No. 2 reactor turbine plant will lower the water level enough that contaminated liquid won't be able to reach the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"I am not able to say for certain whether or not this will be the last discharge, but we certainly would like to avoid releasing any such water into the sea as much as possible,\" agency spokesman Hidehiko Nishiyama said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Officials were still awaiting test results to confirm the water pouring into the ocean is leaking from the highly radioactive No. 2 reactor.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We don't know clearly, but we feel it is somehow leaking from Unit 2,\" Nishiyama said. Even if the water is confirmed to have come from the reactor, neither Tokyo Electric nor government officials know how it is making its way from the reactor to the leaking pit, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the water is pumped out of the waste treatment reservoir, the agency believes it can safely transfer the water from the basement of the No. 2 turbine plant to the reservoir without further leaks, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though Japanese officials say the water being discharged is less radioactive than the water now leaking into the sea, its top concentration of radioactive iodine-131 is 20 becquerels per cubic centimeter, or 200,000 becquerels per kilogram. That's 10 times the level of radioactivity permitted in food. But since it's being dumped into the Pacific, it will be quickly diluted, according to Dr. James Cox, a radiation oncologist at Houston's MD Anderson Cancer Center and a CNN consultant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reactors No. 1 and No. 3, which have lower levels of water, need to be drained as well. Tokyo Electric's plan is to pump that water to other storage tanks, including some that still need to be set up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Attempts to fill the 20-centimeter (8-inch) crack outside the No. 2 reactor's turbine building -- on Saturday by pouring in concrete, then Sunday by using a chemical compound mixed with sawdust and newspaper -- were not successful.\n",
      "\n",
      "As officials mull other ways to cut off the leak at its source, workers will install a silt fence along a damaged sea wall surrounding the plant, Nishiyama said. The aim of this screening, usually used to halt erosion at construction sites, is to prohibit the spread of radioactive particles into the sea.\n",
      "\n",
      "Workers also have injected a dye tracer into the water to allow them to track the dispersal of such particles, the spokesman added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addressing the issue quickly is critical because officials believe it is a source of alarmingly high radiation levels in seawater near the plant, as well as in nearby groundwater.\n",
      "\n",
      "Complicating the situation is the fact that, in some cases, authorities don't even know how much radiation is getting out.\n",
      "\n",
      "After some high-profile errors, little new information on water, ground and air radiation has been released since Thursday. One reason is that the dosimeters being used don't go above 1,000 millisieverts per hour, said Junichi Matsumoto, an executive with Tokyo Electric.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities know the water in the cracked concrete shaft is emitting at least that much radiation -- which equates, at a minimum, to more than 330 times the dose an average resident of an industrialized country naturally receives in a year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plugging the external leak is job one, in order to prevent the outflow of radiation into the Pacific. But it may not be the most difficult, or important, task ahead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities still have to figure out how the tainted water got into the concrete shaft in the first place. The water had to come from somewhere, potentially traveling across melted-down nuclear fuel in the reactor's core before somehow reaching the outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We were assuming and hoping (that water) would stay in the containment vessel as vapor after being cooled,\" Nishiyama, the nuclear safety official, said Sunday. \"However, it may have flowed into the building, and then the trench.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Determining why and how that happened -- and what to do about it -- may be \"exceptionally challenging,\" said physicist James Acton, with the Washington-based Carnegie Endowment think tank. Officials may have to inspect a complex array of pipes inside the dangerous radioactive environment inside the containment buildings.\n",
      "\n",
      "The state of the Nos. 5 and 6 units is another new problem. Water in their turbine buildings' basements threatens the power supply for the system used to cool nuclear material in these units' spent fuel pools, Edano said. This makes it imperative to pump out that water, which will end up into the sea like that from around the Nos. 3 and 4 units.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Though those reactors are stable at the moment, the growing water level in the turbine houses may disturb their stability,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The effort to keep the Nos. 1, 2 and 3 reactor cores and spent fuel pools cool took a step forward Sunday, when the electricity source powering those three units' cooling systems was switched from a temporary diesel generator to a more permanent, external power supply, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency's website.\n",
      "\n",
      "Authorities hope this step, as well as preventing damage to the Nos. 5 and 6 units' power supply, will help to minimize the prospect of any more radiation that might contaminate tap water or food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Farmers have pushed for lower standards on radiation in food, calling them unnecessarily stringent. On Monday, Edano said these limits would not change, even as he outlined a process in which sales restrictions on certain crops, in certain areas, would be lifted if they test safe three times in a row.\n",

      "\n",
      "ST. LOUIS — When the St. Louis Cardinals were down to their apparent final strike of the season, in both the ninth and 10th innings of Game 6 on Thursday night, Manager Tony La Russa told his players in the dugout not to forget to thank the fans for their support amid what was looking like a crushing season-ending loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "After defying elimination for nearly two months, it appeared that the Cardinals’ unlikely playoff run was finally coming to a conclusion, and even La Russa was prepared to concede defeat.\n",
      "\n",
      "But less than 24 hours later, it was the fans thanking the Cardinals with a shower of applause and cheers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In one of the wildest, most improbable championship runs in memory, the Cardinals beat the Texas Rangers, 6-2, in Game 7 of the World Series on Friday night to win the storied club’s 11th championship.\n",
      "\n",
      "”Has there ever been a more entertaining, better team in St. Louis and has won a championship?” said the veteran outfielder Lance Berkman, who won his first World Series after 13 seasons in baseball. “I wasn’t there in the ’60s or ’80s when they won championships. But my goodness, what a team this is.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Continue reading the main story\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a team that was 10 1/2 games out of a playoff spot on Aug. 25 and played a month of virtual playoff games before earning a place in the postseason on a crazy last day of the regular season.\n",
      "\n",
      "They sneaked into the playoffs with the fewest wins, 90, of any playoff team, and weaved their way through the postseason, trailing their opponents in all three series, and even faced match point twice in a Game 6 for the ages Thursday night.\n",
      "\n",
      "“When you play with that kind of urgency, it’s a little scary at times and it takes a lot out of you,” said La Russa, who won his third title, and second with the Cardinals. “But it’s really fun to compete this way.”\n",
      "\n",
      "They won Game 6 behind the late-inning heroics of the World Series most valuable player David Freese, setting up a decisive Game 7 on Friday, and sent their ace to the mound to win it for them, just as he did in Game 5 of the division series against the favored Philadelphia Phillies.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind six dogged innings from that ace, Chris Carpenter, who was pitching on short rest, the Cardinals managed to beat the Rangers for the second straight game (Texas hadn’t lost consecutive games since Aug. 23-25).\n",
      "\n",
      "The loss was a bitter ending for a Rangers team looking to make amends for losing to the San Francisco Giants in last year’s World Series. They had won two games in a row, and in Game 6 on Thursday night, they were twice within a strike of winning the franchise’s first World Series title.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If there’s one thing that happened in this World Series that I’ll look back on, it’s being so close,” Texas Manager Ron Washington said. “Just having one pitch to be made, one out to be gotten and it could have been a different story. But when you are a champion, you keep fighting and St. Louis fought and came back. They got us yesterday, and they beat us tonight.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The final out came when David Murphy hit a fly ball to left field off closer Jason Motte that was caught by Allen Craig, igniting a celebration by these most improbable champions. As the players jumped on the field, the coaches, led by La Russa, waited in front of the dugout and hugged one another.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first player to join them was the slugger Albert Pujols, who lifted La Russa off the ground with a championship bear hug. Both men, who along with Carpenter were with the Cardinals when they won their last World Series in 2006, are at the end of their contracts and could end up leaving St. Louis behind on this note of euphoria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Neither would address the subject directly, but when La Russa was asked if now would be a good time to announce he was coming back, he said, “Well, I don’t want to spoil the moment.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The M.V.P. trophy given to Freese, who had two runs batted in to bring the Cardinals back from a two-run deficit in the first inning, was a fitting reward for a kid from suburban St. Louis who grew up dreaming of playing for the Cardinals. He was also the M.V.P. of the National League Championship Series and set a record with 21 runs batted in during the postseason.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I sit here right now and I still can’t believe we actually did this,” he said. “I keep thinking about mid-August, the mood of the team and the disappointment, and Carp said, ‘Let’s get together and talk about some things.’ ”\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a team meeting Carpenter called in August when the Cardinals were only a handful of games over .500. At that point, there were no thoughts of the World Series, or even the playoffs. It was a much more sobering goal.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It was about not embarrassing ourselves,” Carpenter said.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was obviously no embarrassment Friday when Carpenter took the mound on three days’ rest and allowed only two runs in six innings. His performance wasn’t as dominant as his Game 5 shutout of the Phillies in the division series, but it was good enough to put his team in position to win a World Series.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rangers scored two runs in the first inning. Ian Kinsler, their leadoff batter, hit the second pitch of the game into left field for a single. He was picked off first base, but Elvis Andrus walked and then scored when Josh Hamilton, who had hit a two-run homer in the 10th inning of Game 6, doubled to right. Hamilton then scored on a double by Michael Young.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cardinals got both runs back off Matt Harrison, the Rangers’ starter, as Freese took another star turn. In his first at-bat after his game-ending home run Thursday night, Freese ripped a double into left-center field, scoring Pujols and Berkman, who had walked ahead of him.\n",
      "\n",
      "In three successive at-bats from Game 6 to Game 7, Freese had a triple that tied Game 6 in the ninth inning when the Rangers were one strike away from winning, a home run to win the game in the 11th, and then the double in his first at-bat of Game 7 for five R.B.I.\n",
      "\n",
      "The score remained tied until the third inning, when Craig hit his third home run of the series, a solo shot into the Cardinals’ bullpen on a full-count offering from Harrison.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cardinals added to their lead in the fifth by scoring twice without getting a hit. Things began falling apart for the Rangers’ bullpen, which seemed to run out of steam in the final few games. When the inning was over, St. Louis led, 5-2, and the final three and a half innings had the feel of a coronation.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cardinals had wrenched the momentum away from the Rangers in Game 6, and they would not surrender it. After Game 6, La Russa told his players that they needed to put it in a box, forget about it, and focus on Game 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Now it’s time to think about Game 6,” he said, “and that’s part of this historic run. I mean, it’s hard to explain how we made it happen except the club has great guts. Really, we have more talent than people think, but we have great guts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "When it was over, the Cardinals finally got the chance to thank their loyal fans. But late Friday night, the fans could thank them back.\n",

      "Supreme Court upholds key part of Arizona law for now, strikes down other provisions\n",
      "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139\n",
      "7-9 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "The Supreme Court on Monday struck down several key parts of Arizona’s tough law on illegal immigrants, but it left standing a controversial provision requiring police to check the immigration status of people they detain and suspect to be in the country illegally.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 5 to 3 decision upholding the “show me your papers” provision came with a warning that the courts would be watching its implementation. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer (R) declared victory and said police could enforce the law without resorting to profiling based on ethnicity.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the ruling, which re­inforced the federal government’s primacy in immigration policy, also vindicated the Obama administration’s decision to challenge the Arizona law almost from the moment it was passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The justices will rule Thursday on the constitutionality of President Obama’s most important priority before the court: the health-care law, his signature domestic achievement. It will be the final day of a term that has been dominated by questions about the power of the federal government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The immigration decision comes as the issue has taken a central spot in the nation’s political conversation and domestic agenda, even as the numbers of illegal immigrants coming to this country have fallen. It is likely to be just one in a series of court decisions about the role states may play in combating illegal immigration; five states have adopted laws similar to Arizona’s, and others are waiting in the wings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obama recently ignited new controversy by announcing that many immigrants under age 30 who were brought to this country illegally by their parents would not be deported. In an unusual moment Monday, a dissenting Justice Antonin Scalia mentioned Obama’s policy as he spoke from the bench to criticize the majority’s decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "In oral arguments on the Arizona law, the justices had seemed skeptical of the administration’s vision of the subordinate role states must play in immigration matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Justice Anthony M. Kennedy spelled out states’ limited role, even as he acknowledged criticism that the failure of Congress and the executive branch to form a comprehensive immigration strategy has led to severe hardships.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Arizona may have under­standable frustrations with the problems caused by illegal immigration while that process continues,” he wrote, “but the state may not pursue policies that undermine federal law.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The court threw out three such provisions in the Arizona law. It said the state cannot make it a misdemeanor for immigrants to not carry registration documents; criminalize the act of an illegal immigrant seeking employment; or authorize state officers to arrest someone on the belief that the person has committed an offense that makes him deportable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kennedy wrote for Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor. Justice Elena Kagan recused herself from the case, presumably because she had worked on it while serving as Obama’s solicitor general.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalia and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote dissents from the decision. In reading his dissent, Scalia made clear the extent of his disagreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Arizona has moved to protect its sovereignty — not in contradiction of federal law, but in complete compliance with it,” he wrote. “If securing its territory in this fashion is not within the power of Arizona, we should cease referring to it as a sovereign state.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Scalia took aim at Obama’s new policy on deportation in the statement he read from the bench, as well as in his dissent, although the issue was not before the court.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The husbanding of scarce enforcement resources can hardly be the justification for this, since those resources will be eaten up by the considerable administrative cost of conducting the nonenforcement program, which will require as many as 1.4 million background checks and biennial rulings on requests for dispensation,” Scalia said.\n",

      "\n",
      "A six- to nine-month horizon for winding down the crisis, laid out by plant owner Tokyo Electric Power this week, is just the beginning. Near the end of that timeline, Japan's government says it will decide when -- or whether -- the nearly 80,000 people who were told to flee their homes in the early days of the disaster can return.\n",

      "\n",
      "Many of those displaced by the disaster have spent a month living in government shelters -- sometimes just gyms -- and are running low on money. Tokyo Electric has promised to make a down payment on compensation of 1 million yen (about $12,000) per household, with the intention of sending out checks by late April.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another 66,000 have been told to prepare for evacuations in towns where radiation readings are at levels that could increase the long-term risk of cancer for anyone who stays. That will certainly add to what is likely to be a staggering tab for the Japanese government and Tokyo Electric, the country's largest utility.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"We are mobilizing our resources in order to tackle the situation, to relieve the burdens on those people who have evacuated from the area,\" Cabinet spokesman Noriyuki Shikata said. \"We know that it's going to cost a quite significant amount.

      "For those displaced, Japanese authorities have promised to decontaminate \"as much of an area as possible,\" as Goshi Hosono, an adviser to Prime Minister Naoto Kan, told reporters earlier this week. But they have no decontamination plans prepared, and no real model for trying to clean up whole municipalities.\n",

      "After Chernobyl -- the worst nuclear disaster to date -- the former Soviet Union and now-independent Ukraine essentially abandoned a 30-kilometer radius around the plant. A quarter-century later, a forest is reclaiming the city of Pripyat, where nearly 50,000 people lived before the accident. About 116,000 were resettled, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and published estimates put the cost of cleanup at more than $350 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Shikata said the situation at Fukushima Daiichi was \"somewhat different\" than at Chernobyl, were the amount of radioactivity released was 10 times higher that is believed to have escaped from Fukushima Daiichi.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest city covered by the evacuation orders so far is Minami Soma, with a population of about 70,000. The twin disasters of March 11 have already driven away most of its population, most of those remaining have been told they will be evacuating soon and the rest have been told to stand by.\n",

      "For those displaced, there are social concerns as well. For decades, the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- known as \"Hibakusha\" -- complained of discrimination due to fears of radiation.

      "As for Fukushima Daiichi itself, fully closing up the crippled plant may take decades, said Jack DeVine, a U.S. nuclear engineer who helped lead the cleanup of the Three Mile Island plant in Pennsylvania. There, it took about three years for engineers to get a look inside the damaged core of the reactor that suffered a partial meltdown in 1979 -- and what they found was \"absolutely shocking\" at the time, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"A substantial amount of core had melted and burned its way into the reactor vessel, which we previously didn't know about,\" said DeVine, now retired. About 25 percent of the fuel assembly had melted, leaving behind a depression in the center of the core \"like a giant ice-cream scoop.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Cleaning up and shutting down the damaged Unit 2 took 10 years, Devine said -- and unlike Fukushima Daiichi, little radiation was released at Three Mile Island. In Japan, workers are dealing with \"essentially four Three Mile Islands,\" plus levels of radioactivity \"which will be an impediment for all the work on-site.\"\n",

      "Two D.C. Metro employees charged with stealing thousands in fares\n",
      "http://www.facebook.com/dana.hedgpeth\n",
      "8-10 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "Metro employee Horace Dexter McDade typically spent his days traveling from one subway station to another, collecting bills and coins from fare machines.\n",
      "\n",
      "Often, Metro Transit Police officer John Vincent Haile was nearby, watching over McDade as he made his rounds and trucked the cash to a collection facility in Alexandria.\n",
      "\n",
      "But authorities allege that the two men have been taking an unofficial detour, driving to a spot near the Capital Beltway a few hundred yards from the collection building and hiding part of the day’s take. When their shift was done, they would return in their own cars and make off with the money.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Wednesday night, federal authorities arrested the pair and charged them with conspiring to commit theft. According to an affidavit filed in U.S. District Court, the two have been conspiring since at least 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "Surveillance tapes and a confidential source revealed that Haile used bags of the collected coins to buy lottery tickets, according to the affidavit. He collected close to $63,000 in winnings over the past four years.\n",
      "\n",
      "A federal judge released McDade, 58, of Bowie and Haile, 54, of Woodbridge with no bond after they made their initial appearance Thursday afternoon. A status conference is set for Monday.\n",
      "\n",
      "McDade told Magistrate Judge T. Rawles Jones Jr. that he plans to hire a lawyer. Haile asked the judge to appoint one for him, according to federal officials. If convicted, McDade and Haile face a maximum penalty of five years in prison.\n",
      "\n",
      "“They were stealing from the very system they’ve been entrusted to protect, defend and support,” Neil H. MacBride, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, said.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was unclear how much money may have been stolen. Prosecutors say that Haile’s bank records show unexplained cash deposits of more than $150,000 since 2008 and that the probe is ongoing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The pair systematically worked stations on Metro’s rail lines in Maryland, the District and Virginia, according to officials involved in the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss it publicly. Investigators found that Haile would often switch his security assignment with other officers so he could work with McDade.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the affidavit, surveillance teams observed McDade and Haile on three days in December and January. The two would ride through a parking lot at a Marriott Courtyard hotel on Eisenhower Avenue to an underpass and hide bags of money they would unload from a Metro van. Later, each man would return separately — Haile in a gray Jaguar and McDade in a green Ford — to get their stashed cash and go their separate ways, according to court records and those involved in the case. Investigators placed Global Positioning System tracking devices on their cars and the Metro van.\n",
      "\n",
      "The underpass is about a quarter-mile from Metro’s revenue-collection facility and is in the opposite direction of Haile’s route home to Woodbridge, authorities said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Haile used stolen money to buy Virginia Lottery tickets — sometimes paying with bags of change, authorities say. Between October and December, he used more than $28,000 in coins and cash to purchase tickets, according to the affidavit filed by Metro Transit Police Capt. Kevin P. Gaddis.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gaddis wrote in the affidavit that the FBI was tipped off to the alleged scheme in September, when it learned about a man dressed in a police uniform who routinely bought several hundred dollars’ worth of scratch-off lottery tickets from a Woodbridge store. A source later told agents that the officer had been going into the store for about three years, at first carrying “what he could hold in his hands” — about 50 to 100 coins — and later bringing in bags containing about $500 in change, the affidavit says. The source reported that Haile spent $13,050 in October, $7,780 in November and $7,350 in December.\n",
      "\n",
      "Haile won a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "Records from the Virginia Lottery show that Haile won $32,000 last year, $17,000 in 2010, $8,400 in 2009 and $5,400 in 2008, according to the affidavit. The document said an informant told officials that Haile had also cashed winning tickets for less than $600. Records aren’t required for the lesser amounts. Gaddis wrote that lottery officials said Haile “must be buying an extraordinary amount of tickets to win with such regularity, often multiple times a month.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Metro chief spokesman Dan Stessel said Thursday that the two men were suspended without pay and that their jobs with Metro were “pending termination.” Stessel would not disclose their salaries, saying Metro releases that information only about its executive leadership team.\n",
      "\n",
      "McDade had worked for Metro since February 1979. In 1989, he was convicted in Prince George’s County on two counts of possession of a controlled substance. He was fined $500 and was sentenced to two years, but most of it was suspended, according to court records.\n",
      "\n",
      "Haile had worked for the Metro Transit Police since August 1997.\n",
      "\n",
      "The supervisor of the revenue facility in Alexandria has “been relieved of his duties,” according to a Metro news media release. Stessel would not identify that person, saying that the “action is a personnel matter rather than a criminal matter.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Metro General Manager Richard Sarles said Thursday afternoon that he was “thoroughly disgusted and dismayed” by McDade and Haile’s alleged actions. He described the alleged scheme as a “betrayal to all the honest employees of Washington Metro.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Stessel said Metro collects about $38 million a month from rail fares — $18 million in cash, the rest from debit and credit cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "Collecting the money is tricky. Metro uses a special train, known as the “Money Train,” that is made up of several rail cars and runs only at night. The only passengers are heavily armed Metro Transit Police officers and technicians who collect money in large silver cases on wheels. The train is taken to the rail yard in Alexandria, where there is a facility to collect and sort the cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "McDade, the revenue technician, was part of a special team that supplements the Money Train. Known as “Emergencies,” those members are allowed to go out accompanied by just a single Metro Transit Police officer to “replenish money in the machines and retrieve money from the machines that are full,” according to the affidavit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stessel would not explain how Metro reconciles how much is collected at fare machines and then taken to the Alexandria facility, saying, “Those are details that pertain to an ongoing criminal investigation.”\n",
      "\n",
      "It isn’t the first time workers handling Metro’s money have been accused of stealing.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2004, Metro switched from allowing patrons to pay with cash at its parking facilities to requiring that they use electronic SmarTrip cards after an investigation found cashiers hired by a contractor had stolen millions of dollars in revenue over several years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarles said the transit agency’s chief financial officer will “immediately bring in forensic accountants to conduct a thorough review of control systems and management over revenue systems to fully understand how wrongdoing occurred and to implement tighter detection systems.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The transit agency’s inspector general is also conducting reviews, and Metro Transit Police Chief Michael Taborn is expected to conduct a “top-to-bottom assessment of all policies and procedures” involving officers assigned to the revenue-collection unit, officials said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case comes as Metro considers asking riders to pay higher fares and parking fees to help fill a $116 million budget gap for fiscal 2013. Riders, already stressed from service delays, chronic equipment failures and constant maintenance work, are unhappy at that prospect.\n",
      "\n",
      "Metro workers, angry at their colleagues, worried Thursday that the alleged thefts further tarnish the transit authority’s reputation.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It all looks bad for those of us on the front lines,” said a train operator who spoke on the condition of anonymity because employees are not allowed to talk to the media without permission. “If you have on a Metro uniform, people already say things to you like: ‘You’re stupid. When are you going to finish this?’\n",

      "Ohio State University hired Urban Meyer as its football coach Monday, giving him one of the richest contracts ever in college sports — the latest indication that the big business of college football is undeterred by the nation’s broader economic woes or by concern about the prominence of sports on campus.\n",
      "\n",
      "The contract includes $4 million in base salary, bonuses — for everything from players’ graduation rates to playing in a national championship, up to $700,000 annually — and lump payments in 2014, 2016 and 2018. The deal is worth more than three times the $1.32 million that the university’s president, E. Gordon Gee, made in 2010, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Meyer and Ohio State reached the lucrative deal amid a chaotic year in college athletics. The University of Miami was rocked by a report that a donor lavished football players with gifts for years; and longtime assistants for the Penn State football and Syracuse men’s basketball teams are facing allegations that they sexually abused young boys. Several other prominent programs are being investigated by college athletics’ governing body, the N.C.A.A., for myriad violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even the Buckeyes await potential N.C.A.A. sanctions because players traded memorabilia for cash and tattoos, which led to the ouster of Jim Tressel as their coach six months ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, the college football arms race shows no signs of slowing. To replace Mr. Tressel, Ohio State will invest at least $26.65 million over six years in Mr. Meyer, 47, who won two national championships at Florida. That will include an annual automobile stipend, a golf club membership, 50 hours of private jet use and 12 tickets to each home game.\n",

      "“It’s symbolic of the condition we’re in,” said William C. Friday, the president of the University of North Carolina system from 1956 to 1986. “There’s an unrestrained salary march, where universities are trying to superimpose an entertainment industry on an academic structure. Any salary in that range is excessive.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even Mr. Gee, the university president who hired Mr. Meyer on Monday, has described the system as broken. In an interview with The New York Times in August, he said: “College athletics has gotten beyond itself. Do I think it’s broken? Yes.”\n",

      "\n",
      "“I’m not certain I’ve ever made as much as a football coach,” Mr. Gee said in a telephone interview. “We live in a world of markets and opportunities. A number of surgeons here make more than I do. I’m about having the best physics faculty, the best medical school faculty and the best football coach.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Friday was a co-founder of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. He watched as shoe companies paid large sums to coaches, as broadcast deals boomed. What Mr. Friday called the “invasion of money for commercial television” started about 10 years ago, he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, by any financial measure, college football has never been more prosperous. Five sports conferences have signed billion-dollar broadcast deals, fueled by the popularity of football.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the Pacific-12 Conference, where games were once shown on national networks and local channels, officials have decided to create six regional networks instead. The template: the network for the Big Ten Conference, which includes Ohio State. The Big Ten network, according to SNL Kagan, a research firm, earned $227.1 million for the conference in 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "Contracts for college football coaches have increased at a similarly rapid pace. If Mr. Meyer reaches his benchmarks for bonuses, he will be among — and may even surpass — the upper echelon of college football coaches: Mack Brown at Texas, Nick Saban at Alabama, Bob Stoops at Oklahoma and Les Miles at Louisiana State.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr. Gee said that according to Ohio State’s data on college football coaches’ salaries, Mr. Meyer would rank fourth among his peers, emphasizing that much of Mr. Meyer’s bonuses is tied to academics and his staying at O.S.U. for all six years.\n",
      "\n",
      "An analysis this month by USA Today found the average salary for a major college head coach jumped nearly 55 percent in the past six seasons, to $1.47 million this year from $950,000 in 2006. This season, according to the analysis, 64 coaches made at least $1 million, with three over $4 million and Mr. Brown of Texas over $5 million, making him the highest-compensated coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "For David Ridpath, a professor of sports administration at Ohio University and a member of the Drake Group, a network of professors who lobby for academic integrity in college sports, this represents far more than the going rate, which is the typical justification used by universities.\n",

      "“We’ve long gone past anything that’s reasonable,” he said. “If you put too much value on a program, it starts to swallow the university. It starts to guide the moral compass. Soon, a coach is going to make $10 million a year. There’s just no stopping it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Early in his career, Mr. Meyer worked as a graduate assistant at Ohio State, starting in 1986. The coach who hired him, Earle Bruce, reportedly earned $87,000 a year. Now, despite the increase, the Buckeyes believe Mr. Meyer is worth every penny of his contract.\n",
      "\n",
      "His decorated coaching résumé includes a 104-23 record in 10 seasons as the coach at Bowling Green, Utah and Florida. He holds a 7-1 record in bowl games and a 4-0 mark in Bowl Championship Series games.\n",
      "\n",
      "Citing health concerns, Mr. Meyer said he was retiring from coaching in December 2009. A day later, he said he would continue coaching. After the 2010 season, he again announced his retirement, citing family reasons. He has spent this season as an analyst for ESPN.\n",
      "\n",
      "A native of Ashtabula, Ohio, Mr. Meyer returns to right the state’s most prominent program. Ohio State, with the 100,000-plus fans who pack its stadium for home games, with college football as its cash machine, sputtered to a 6-6 record this season under the interim coach Luke Fickell and lost to its rival Michigan for the first time since 2003.\n",
      "\n",
      "At his news conference Monday, Mr. Meyer said he felt “fantastic” and had learned from his time away from coaching.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Meyer was being hired, several coaches at major programs have been fired in the past few days, including Turner Gill (Kansas), Dennis Erickson (Arizona State), Rick Neuheisel (U.C.L.A.) and Ron Zook (Illinois). Gill is owed roughly $6 million.\n",

      "“Some schools want to pay their coach more than anybody else,” said Dick Tomey, who made $35,000 in 1977 in his first head-coaching job at Hawaii, where he is now an assistant. “That’s part of it. But that adds to the pressure, which is why you see a lot of guys losing their jobs.”\n",

Meyer won the Bowl Championship Series national title game against Ohio State in 2007, not the Fiesta Bowl in 2008. The caption also misidentified the coach Meyer succeeded at Ohio State.

Quarterback Eli Manning engineered the big drive in crunch time when the Giants needed it and New York beat the Patriots, 21-17, on Sunday night at Lucas Oil Stadium in another down-to-the-wire Super Bowl between these rivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "A season that began with Manning declaring himself an elite quarterback ended with him backing up that proclamation with his second Super Bowl most valuable player performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I just know we’re world champions tonight,” Manning said, “and that’s what I’m most proud of.”\n",
      "\n",
      "After crafting six fourth-quarter, game-winning drives during the regular season, five of them to cap fourth-quarter comebacks, Manning pulled off that feat again in another nerve-rattling Super Bowl. The Giants, trailing by two points, drove 88 yards to the winning touchdown on a six-yard run by tailback Ahmad Bradshaw with 57 seconds left.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was one of the oddest game-winning touchdowns in Super Bowl history. The Patriots, trying to preserve their final timeout and precious seconds on the clock for their offense, allowed Bradshaw to score. Bradshaw, realizing that, attempted to stop just shy of the goal line but tumbled into the end zone.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We didn’t talk about it” before the play, Bradshaw said. “Eli was handing me the ball and telling me not to score. I tried to tap myself down, declare myself down, but my momentum carried me into the end zone. It was a strange play.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Said Manning: “It’s a mistake by me. I had a feeling they might do that. I should have told him [before the play] not to score.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The strategy didn’t work. The Giants failed on a two-point conversion attempt and the Patriots took over at their 20-yard line for a last-gasp drive. Brady kept them alive with a fourth-and-16 completion, and New England reached its 49-yard line. But Brady’s desperation heave into the distant end zone as time expired was tipped and fell incomplete beyond the outstretched hands of Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We just came up a little bit short,” Brady said. “I think we had a couple of missed opportunities out there. Every guy in the locker room wishes he could have done a little bit more.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Belichick acknowledged instructing his defense to let the Giants score, saying he didn’t want the clock to wind down for a short-range Giants field goal that almost certainly would have been successful. His players backed their coach.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Bill has always put us in the best position to succeed,” Patriots safety James Ihedigbo said. “No matter what, we trust him. He wanted to put the ball in Tom’s hands. That’s the decision he made and we support him.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Brady said: “I like it. . . . We had a chance to win there at the end. We just didn’t do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Giants became the first team to win a Super Bowl after going 9-7 in the regular season. They won six straight games, four of them in the postseason, after their record dropped to 7-7.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We’ve won so many games like this,” Giants Coach Tom Coughlin said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Manning had a touchdown pass and completed 30 of 40 passes for 296 yards. He didn’t throw an interception as he secured his second Super Bowl triumph over the Patriots in tandem with Coughlin. Manning also was the MVP four years ago when the Giants denied the Patriots what would have been the first 19-0 season in NFL history.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This isn’t about one person,” Manning said. “This about a team coming together, getting this win. I’m just proud of our guys, proud of the team and how we fought all year.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Giants jumped to an early 9-0 lead on a safety, courtesy of an intentional-grounding penalty on Brady in the end zone, and a touchdown pass from Manning to wide receiver Victor Cruz. But the Patriots scored 17 straight points as Brady threw touchdown passes to running back Danny Woodhead and tight end Aaron Hernandez, at one point completing 16 straight passes, to break the mark of 13 set by Hall of Fame quarterback Joe Montana.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brady threw an interception as he went 27 for 41 for 276 yards. He was denied in his bid to match the record of four Super Bowl victories for a quarterback by Montana, his boyhood hero, and Terry Bradshaw. Belichick failed in his attempt to tie Chuck Noll for the most Super Bowl triumphs by a coach with four.\n",
      "\n",
      "After two Lawrence Tynes field goals, the Patriots led 17-15 entering the fourth quarter. But Brady threw his lone interception to Giants linebacker Chase Blackburn, who outleaped an injured Gronkowski for the ball, and it was Manning who made the necessary plays down the stretch. Gronkowski had only two catches for the Patriots as he played on an injured ankle.\n",
      "\n",
      "On another critical play with time running down and Patriots looking to pad their lead, the usually sure-handed Wes Welker, who led the NFL in receptions this year, could not come up with a difficult pass from Brady.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It hurts to get that close and fall short,” Patriots guard Logan Mankins said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Giants dominated in the early going, running 19 of the game’s first 20 plays. Manning completed his first nine passes, the best start to a game in Super Bowl history.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brady gave the Giants the lead when he released a throw from his own end zone just before being hit by defensive end Justin Tuck, and was called for intentional grounding when the pass landed on the turf deep down the middle of the field with no receiver nearby. The Giants took the resulting free kick by the Patriots and drove to the game’s first touchdown on Manning’s two-yard pass to Cruz.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Patriots finally started moving on offense but had to settle for a 29-yard field goal by kicker Stephen Gostkowski. The New England defense toughened in the second quarter and Brady found his rhythm, completing his final 11 first-half passes. He was 10 for 10 as the Patriots went 96 yards, matching the longest drive in Super Bowl history, en route to a touchdown eight seconds before halftime on Brady’s four-yard pass to Woodhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brady was 5 for 5 on the Patriots’ opening second-half drive. His 16th straight completion was a 12-yard touchdown strike to Hernandez. The Giants replied with a pair of field goals by Tynes later in the third quarter.\n",

      "\n",
      "(CNN) -- Japan raised the severity level of its nuclear crisis to the maximum level seven on Tuesday, putting the Fukushima Daiichi power plant disaster on a par with the Chernobyl accident in 1986.\n",
      "\n",
      "The decision to raise the crisis level up from five to seven came after a review of the amount of radiation released in the month since the plant was severely damaged by the earthquake and subsequent tsunami, says Japan's official nuclear watchdog, the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency (NISA).\n",
      "\n",
      "Level seven on the International Nuclear Event Scale (INES) incidents involve a major release of radiation with widespread health and environmental effects, according to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).\n",

      "Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano, the Japanese government's leading spokesman on the crisis, said on Tuesday: \"The change in the level reminds us the accident is very big. I apologize to the residents of the area, the people of Japan and the international community.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Does the change to level 7 have any immediate consequences?\n",
      "\n",
      "No, according to nuclear experts, who say the change in level is a reassessment of the month-long disaster rather than a reaction to a recent event at the plant.\n",
      "\n",
      "Professor Francis Livens, Research Director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute in Manchester, England, said: \"They have taken stock, they have got to the point where they have some level of stability and enough time has passed for them to evaluate the full impact of the disaster.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Is the upgrade to level 7 justified?\n",
      "\n",
      "The disaster was classified as a level 5 accident on March 18 says NISA.\n",
      "\n",
      "The environmental pressure group Greenpeace argues that the level should have been upgraded to level 7 in late March, while others are more cautious.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thomas Breuer, Head of the Climate and Energy Unit at Greenpeace, said in a written statement: \"The (nuclear) industry both inside and outside Japan have again been underplaying the human consequences of this terrible tragedy, and only now after a month has this disaster been accepted for what it is - the worst on its scale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Livens says that technically Fukushima is a level-seven incident, although he added that in his opinion Fukushima was a \"low-level seven,\" while Chernobyl was at the upper end of the scale.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fukushima is a very, very serious incident but Chernobyl was a catastrophe,\" Livens added.\n",
      "\n",
      "What do the different levels mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "The INES scale was formulated by scientists for the IAEA, the United Nation's nuclear watchdog, as a way of identifying the severity of incidents involving nuclear energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the Richter scale used to measure earthquakes, the INES scale attempts to grade nuclear disasters on their potential impact.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are seven scales: Levels 1 to 3 are called \"incidents\" while levels 4 to 7 are called \"accidents.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Level 1 is an \"anomaly,\" 2 is an \"incident,\" and level 3 is a \"serious incident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Level 4 is an accident with \"local consequences,\" 5 is an accident with \"wider consequences,\" 6 is a \"serious accident.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Level 7 is: \"A major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures,\" according to the IAEA.\n",
      "\n",
      "What scale have other nuclear disasters been rated at?\n",
      "\n",
      "1957: An explosion in the waste tank at Kyshtym, Russia, was rated as a level 6 accident.\n",
      "\n",
      "1979: The Three Mile Island incident in Pennsylvania was classified a category 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "1957: Windscale in the UK in 1957 was also classified as a category 5.\n",
      "\n",
      "1999: Tokaimura, Japan,1999, level 4, caused by workers breaking safety regulations by mixing dangerously large amounts of treated uranium.\n",
      "\n",
      "1993: Seversk, Russia: Level 4. Tank inside the plant explodes while being cleaned.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, is Fukushima really as bad as Chernobyl?\n",
      "\n",
      "Fukushima and Chernobyl are the only two nuclear accidents to be rated at level 7.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fukushima is a very, very serious incident but Chernobyl was a catastrophe\n",
      "--Professor Francis Livens, Research Director of the Dalton Nuclear Institute\n",
      "\n",
      "However, the Japanese and many experts are keen to point out key differences between the two incidents.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the IAEA, at Chernobyl in the Ukraine (then part of the Soviet Union) a combination of operator error, reactor design error and a lack of safety culture caused the reactor core to explode, releasing a huge amount of radioactive material into the atmosphere in a very short space of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "This resulted in the permanent evacuation of a 30-km radius around the plant. There were 32 deaths among plant workers and firefighters, mostly due to radiation exposure, and the IAEA estimates another 4,000 will or have died of related cancers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Fukushima experienced a relatively small hydrogen explosion at reactor No. 1, the reactors are largely intact and overall there has been a smaller leak of radiation over a longer period of time.\n",
      "\n",
      "NISA on Tuesday said they now estimate that the Fukushima plant's reactors released up to 10,000 terabecquerels of radioactive iodine-131 per hour into the air for several hours after they were seriously damaged on March 11.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they estimate that up to 630,000 terabequerels has been estimated at the stricken plant which would classify the crisis at level 7. In comparison the Japanese government said the release from Chernobyl was 5.2 million terabecquerels.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hidehiko Nishiyama, the chief spokesman for NISA said the amount of radiation released is a tenth of what was released at Chernobyl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Livens said: \"Less radiation has been released and as a vague calculation it is 5 or 10% of that released at Chernobyl.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "The level of radiation released is reflected in the health impact\n",
      "\n",
      "Another difference between Fukushima and Chernobyl is that the Ukrainian plant had a higher density of people living near it.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Malcolm Grimston, Associate Fellow for Energy, Environment and Development at London's Chatham House, the single biggest issue following the Chernobyl disaster was radioactive iodine getting into the thyroid gland and causing cancer.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"At Chernobyl they had trouble getting hold of these tablets because it was such a poor area,\" he said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edano said: \"What's different here from the Chernobyl accident is that we have not yet seen a direct impact on the health of the people as a result of the nuclear accident. The accident itself is big, but we will make, as our first priority, our utmost effort to avoid any health impact on the people.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Japanese authorities were quick to distribute iodide tablets to people living near Fukushima.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is radiation?\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of nuclear energy, it is ionizing radiation that is referred to, which passes through matter causing it to become electrically charged or ionized. In living tissues, the electrical ions produced by radiation can affect normal biological processes.\n",

      "https://www.facebook.com/robert.barnes.3139\n",
      "6-7 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "The Supreme Court opened its historic review of the national health-care overhaul Monday with an indication that it will be able to decide the constitutional question of whether Congress exceeded its powers despite arguments that the challenge was brought too soon.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court began the first of three days of oral arguments on the 2010 law by examining a statute that keeps courts from hearing tax challenges before they go into effect. But the justices’ questions indicated skepticism that the penalties prescribed for those who do not buy health insurance by 2014 amount to taxes under the 1867 law forbidding tax challenges.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court on Tuesday will hear arguments about the so-called “individual mandate” that is at the heart of the health-care law.\n",
      "\n",
      "The court had asked Washington lawyer Robert A. Long to present the argument that the obscure 19th-century law — the Anti-Injunction Act — meant that lawsuits brought by 26 states and a private business organization were premature. Long said the court’s precedents showed that the statute should keep any court from hearing the case until someone actually had to pay a penalty on his or her 2015 income tax returns for not purchasing health insurance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long said the “pay first, litigate later rule” could not be waived except by Congress, and it made no such provision in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. He said the penalties called for in the act should be considered the same as taxes because of the way they are collected.\n",
      "\n",
      "A panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed that the Anti-Injunction Act barred a consideration of the merits of the health-care overhaul. But Long was appointed to present that legal argument because neither the Obama administration nor the law’s challengers agree with it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Several of the justices pushed back against Long’s argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just because the penalty is “being collected in the same manner of a tax doesn’t automatically mean it’s a tax,” said Justice Stephen G. Breyer, “particularly since the purpose of the Anti-Injunction Act is to prevent interference with the revenue stream.” This legal challenge does not interfere with revenue collection, Breyer added.\n",
      "\n",
      "Justice Antonin Scalia appeared to agree. As a matter of principle, he said, the courts should not be deprived of jurisdiction in cases unless the reasoning is very clear. “I find it hard to think this is clear, whatever else it is,” Scalia said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., representing the government, said the justices should proceed to deciding the merits of the case.\n",
      "\n",
      "“This case presents issues of great moment, and the Anti-Injunction Act does not bar the court’s consideration of those issues,” Verrilli said.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verrilli had to be careful, though. While he insisted that the penalty is not a tax for Anti-Injunction Act purposes, he is expected to argue as the case proceeds that Congress is within its authority to pass the health-care law in part because of its ability to tax.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Today you are arguing that the penalty is not a tax,” said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. “Tomorrow you will be back and arguing that the penalty is a tax.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Verrilli said what Congress called the penalty was important for purposes of the Anti-Injunction Act, but not to the greater question of its taxing authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The act adopted in 1867 states that “no suit for the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any tax shall be maintained in any court by any person.” It was designed to make sure that the flow of tax collection necessary to keep the government running was not disrupted by lawsuits.\n",
      "\n",
      "As the review began, hundreds of supporters and opponents of the health-care law marched outside the Supreme Court. The demonstrations highlighted the contentiousness of President Obama’s signature domestic initiative, which was signed into law two years ago and continues to galvanize his opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.), a contender for the Republican presidential nomination, made an appearance Monday on the steps of the Supreme Court to campaign against the law — and blast GOP front-runner Mitt Romney. Santorum vowed that, if elected, he would repeal “Obamacare,” which he described as the central issue of his campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "“If you really want Obamacare repealed, there’s only one person who can make that happen,” Santorum told reporters. “Obviously, I don’t believe that Obamacare is constitutional,” he added in response to a question.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the early stages of litigation over the health-care law, the Obama administration agreed that the Anti-Injunction Act barred an immediate constitutional decision. But it dropped that argument and told the Supreme Court that the “penalty” for failure to secure health insurance is not a “tax” for Anti-Injunction Act purposes.\n",
      "\n",
      "The 26 states challenging the Affordable Care Act (ACA), as well as the private organization and individuals who are party to the challenge, also want the court to act now.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The purpose of this lawsuit is to challenge a requirement — a federal requirement to buy health insurance,” Washington lawyer Gregory G. Katsas told the court. “That requirement itself is not a tax. And for that reason alone, we think the Anti-Injunction Act doesn’t apply.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Besides the 4th Circuit panel, the view that the Anti-Injunction Act forecloses a ruling at this time was endorsed by Circuit Judge Brett M. Kavanaugh, an influential conservative member of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Waiting to decide might mean never having to decide,” keeping the courts out of the political fray, Kava­naugh wrote. If there is no change in the law between now and 2015, he said, the constitutional decision could be made then.\n",

      "D.C. Metro Derailment: Excessive Heat To Blame\n",
      "2 minutes\n",
      "\n",
      "Why did three Metro cars derail during rush hour on Friday? Excessive heat.\n",
      "\n",
      "On Saturday, the tenth day in a row with temperatures over 95 degrees in the D.C. area, the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority released a statement saying that investigators think this summer’s heatwave likely caused a “heat kink” in the tracks, which in turn caused the derailment:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Investigators have determined that a misalignment of the rails, known as a “heat kink,” was a probable cause of yesterday’s derailment near West Hyattsville Station. Three cars of an inbound Green Line train derailed at approximately 4:45 p.m. as the train entered a tunnel from an outdoor section of track. There were no injuries.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Heat kinks are short sections of misaligned track caused by the expansion of metal rails in extremely high temperatures and prolonged exposure to direct sunlight. When the expanding rail cannot be constrained by cross-ties and ballast, the rail may expand outward from the normal track alignment.\n",
      "\n",
      "WMATA spokesperson Caroline Lukas told The Huffington Post that there is a speed restriction of 35 miles per hour in place for trains using tracks that are exposed to the sun, and that this restriction will last “at least for the duration of the weekend.” Lukas also said WMATA has “increased track inspections” to look for any other heat kinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also being affected by the heat: roads. WTOP reports that, according to officials, “buckled pavement” is “prevalent” in both Virginia and Maryland.\n",
